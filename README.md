## Installation steps:

### Step 1:

Make sure you have neutron installed, and neutron-lbaas if applicable. This
driver will need to be installed on all of your neutron controller nodes
(anywhere that neutron-server is running.)

### Step 2:

The latest supported version of a10-neutron-lbaas is available via standard pypi repositories and the current development version is available on github.

#### Installation from pypi
```sh
sudo pip install a10-neutron-lbaas
```

#### Installation from cloned git repository.

Download the driver from: <https://github.com/a10networks/a10-neutron-lbaas>

```sh
sudo pip install git+https://github.com/a10networks/a10-neutron-lbaas.git
```

```sh
git clone https://github.com/a10networks/a10-neutron-lbaas.git
cd a10-neutron-lbaas
sudo pip install -e .
```

## Configuration

Post-installation configuration requires modification of your neutron.conf or neutron_lbaas.conf (neutron_lbaas.conf is only present in LBaaSv2) typically located in `/etc/neutron`.

### LBaaS v1 configuration
Open `/etc/neutron/neutron.conf` in your preferred text editor.
Under the `service_plugins` setting, ensure `lbaas` or `lbaasv2` is listed depending on your configuration.

In the list of `service_provider` settings, add a service provider for A10
Networks:
`service_provider = LOADBALANCER:A10Networks:neutron_lbaas.services.loadbalancer.drivers.a10networks.driver_v1.ThunderDriver:default`

Save and close neutron.conf

### LBaaS v2 configuration
Open `/etc/neutron/neutron.conf` in your preferred text editor.
Under the `service_plugins` setting, ensure `lbaasv2` is listed.
Save and close neutron.conf.

Open `/etc/neutron/neutron_lbaas.conf` in your preferred text editor.

In the list of `service_provider` settings, add a service provider for A10
Networks:
`service_provider = LOADBALANCERV2:A10Networks:neutron_lbaas.drivers.a10networks.driver_v2.ThunderDriver:default`

#### Extension configuration
Open `/etc/neutron/neutron.conf` in your preferred text editor.
Under the `service_plugins` setting, ensure `a10_neutron_lbaas.neutron_ext.services.a10_device_instance.plugin.A10DeviceInstancePlugin` is listed. The `service_plugins` are separated by `,`s.

Under the `api_extensions_path` setting, ensure the path to `a10_neutron_lbaas.neutron_ext.extensions` is listed. The `api_extensions_path`s are separated by `:`s. You can find the path of the installed extension by running `python -c "import os; import a10_neutron_lbaas.neutron_ext.extensions as m; print(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(m.__file__)))"`.

#### Device configuration

After installation, you will need to provide configuration for the driver so the driver is aware of the appliances you have configured.  The configuration is a python file stored in `/etc/a10/config.py`.  Below is a sample to show options and formatting, though any legal python can be used to calculate values or define classes:
```python
devices = {
    "ax1": {
        "name": "ax1",
        "host": "10.10.100.20",
        "port": 443,
        "username": "admin",
        "password": "a10",
        "autosnat": True,
        "api_version": "3.0",
    }
}
```

#### vThunder Appliance Configuration

A10's LBaaS driver supports a default scheduling strategy of "one appliance per tenant".  Below is a sample configuration (stored in `/etc/a10/config.py`):
```python
vthunder = {
    'username': 'admin',
    'password': 'a10',

    'api_version': '3.0',

    'nova_flavor': 'acos.min',
    'glance_image': 'c2722746-0c06-48b1-93c3-a9dbc2f6e628',

## Install database migrations

If 'use_database' is enabled, after installing the package and after any
upgrades, run:

```
a10-manage upgrade
```

## Restart necessary services

Restart neutron after configuration updates (exact command may vary depending
  on OpenStack packaging.)

```sh
service neutron-server restart
```

## Example architectures

You must configure the network elements of the Thunder appliance for OpenStack.

## Verifying installation (lbaas v1)

### Step 1:

Login to the OpenStack dashboard.

![image7](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1424573/2849592/46f86d4a-d0df-11e3-8b57-25d2d796f1cc.png)

### Step 2:

Under the “Network” menu, go to the “Load Balancers” tab and select “Add Pool”:

![image8](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1424573/2849594/47169bda-d0df-11e3-9fda-af2da76cdb00.png)

Once you have added a pool, a success message should appear.

### Step 3:

Login to the GUI on your Thunder or AX device, and validate which configuration was applied if the ADPs are set. The ADP name is the first 13 characters of the tenant ID.

_Repeat this for all configuration steps, then delete all resources if ADPs are configured. They should be deleted when the tenant has no more resources configured._

## Default and Name-based configuration
