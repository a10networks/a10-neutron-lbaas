# hardware appliances and manually orchestrated A10 devices. This hook
# primarily makes use of the 'devices' hash table below to find available
# ACOS devices.

# The second hooks class provided is the VThunderPlumbingHooks, which will
# spawn a virtual appliance for every VIP, inside a service tenant space.
# It's settings primarily come from the 'vthunder' hash defined at the
